Hippo is a Higgs web dashboard for Belisarius. It is the place where all the posts the bot catches are sent. Most of its features are publicly available, however you need to sign in to send feedback.

Higgs is developed by [Rob](https://github.com/rjrudman) and hosted by Das_Geek. The GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/SOBotics/Higgs).

Here's how a report looks like:

- The prepended string `Answer to:` is added by the code and it means that the post is an answer.
- Current body contains the text the latest revision had at the time of reporting.
- Similarly, last body contains the text the previous revision had at the time of reporting.
- Confidence is the score of each reason.
