# Auto-comments

Sometimes, it's good to leave some comments in a vandalised post to help OP understand what they did wrong. Here are some you can use.
They are in the format used by the [Stack Exchange AutoReview Coments userscript](https://stackapps.com/q/2116/58907) so that you can import and use them easily.

```
###[Q] Vandalism
Please don't make more work for others by vandalizing your posts. By posting on the Stack Exchange (SE) network, you've granted a non-revocable right, under the [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0), for SE to distribute the content (i.e. regardless of your future choices). By SE policy, the non-vandalized version is distributed. Thus, any vandalism will be reverted. Please see: [How does deleting work?](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/5221). If permitted to delete, there's a "delete" button below the post, on the left, but it's only in browsers, not the mobile app.
###[Q] Editing the question to add solution
I'm glad you found a solution to your problem. However, an actual answer/solution should **not** be edited into your question. In general, you should [edit] the question to *clarify* it, but not to include an answer within it. You should create your own answer with the code/solution you used to solve your problem, and then accept it (the system may require a 48 hour delay prior to doing so). When you've solved the problem yourself, [answering your own question is encouraged](/help/self-answer).
###[Q] Invalidating a question
Editing questions to improve them (e.g. adding additional information, etc.) is encouraged. However, editing a question to change it into a different one, which invalidates one or more answers, is against the [policy](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/290297) on Stack Overflow. Your edit here did so. The policy is that other users with edit privileges should revert such changes. I have reverted your edit. You are encouraged to [ask a new question](/questions/ask), perhaps with a link to this one for additional context. We want to help, but your new/additional issue needs to be a new question.
